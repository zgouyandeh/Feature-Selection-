# What is Feature Selection?
Feature selection, also known as variable/predictor selection, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in machine learning model construction.

Machine learning works on a simple rule – if you put garbage in, you will only get garbage to come out. By garbage here, I mean noise in data.

This becomes even more important when the number of features is very large. You need not use every feature at your disposal for creating an algorithm. You can assist your algorithm by feeding in only those features that are really important. “Sometimes, less is better!”

You not only reduce the training time and the evaluation time, but you also have fewer things to worry about!
